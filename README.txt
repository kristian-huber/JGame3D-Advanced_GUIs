This is a game I was working on in my free time and it uses LWJGL and some other libraries. I used the ThinMatrix tutorial series to get started but I modified the code, such as the Texture and Model Managers. The main feature in this version is the GUIs. I made the wooden button and scrolls myself but the background in the beggining is a picture from the Mount and Blade series.
